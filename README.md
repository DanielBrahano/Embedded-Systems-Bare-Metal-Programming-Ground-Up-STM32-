# Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up™ (STM32)

Welcome to my repository for the **Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up™ (STM32)** course! This repository contains all the code samples, exercises, and materials that I’m working on as I progress through the course.

## Course Journey

As I delve into this course, I’m learning the fundamentals of bare-metal programming on STM32 microcontrollers. The goal is to master low-level programming techniques and interact directly with hardware without relying on higher-level libraries or operating systems.

### What I’m Learning

- **STM32 Microcontroller Basics**: Exploring the architecture and features of STM32 MCUs.
- **Bare-Metal Programming**: Writing code that runs directly on hardware, free from OS abstractions.
- **GPIO and Peripherals**: Configuring GPIO pins and using various peripherals effectively.
- **Interrupts and Timers**: Implementing interrupt handling and utilizing timers for precise control.
- **Memory Management**: Understanding and managing memory, including stack and heap.
- **Debugging**: Applying debugging techniques to troubleshoot and enhance embedded applications.

## Repository Structure

- **/Src**: Contains source code examples and exercises from the course.
- **/Inc**: Header files related to the source code.
- **/Docs**: Documentation and any additional resources I've found useful.
- **.metadata**: IDE-specific files (excluded from version control).

### Device Required

To run the code provided in this repository, you'll need the following hardware:

- **STM32 Nucleo F401RE Development Board**

This board features the STM32F401RE microcontroller and provides a comprehensive platform for embedded development.
